# Task 11: Implement card flip animations with React Native Reanimated

## Priority: Medium

## Description
Create smooth, performant 3D card flip animations using React Native Reanimated.

## Animation Specifications
- **Type**: 3D flip around Y-axis
- **Duration**: 400-600ms
- **Easing**: Spring or ease-in-out curve
- **Performance**: Maintain 60fps
- **Interaction**: Disable during animation

## Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Key animations:
- rotateY: 0deg to 180deg
- opacity transitions for front/back
- scale: subtle grow on touch (1.0 to 1.05)
- shadow effects during flip
```

## React Native Reanimated Setup
1. Install and configure Reanimated 3
2. Use `useSharedValue` for rotation state
3. Implement `useAnimatedStyle` for transforms
4. Add gesture handler for touch feedback

## Animation Phases
1. **Touch Down**: Slight scale increase
2. **Flip Start**: Begin rotation, fade out front
3. **Midpoint**: Switch content visibility
4. **Flip End**: Complete rotation, fade in back
5. **Settle**: Return to normal scale

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Flip animation runs at consistent 60fps
- [ ] No jank or stuttering during animation
- [ ] Front/back content switches at correct time
- [ ] Touch feedback feels responsive
- [ ] Animation works on all iOS devices
- [ ] Memory efficient (no leaks)

## Performance Optimization
- Use native driver for animations
- Minimize re-renders during animation
- Preload animation values
- Test on older devices
