# Task 15: Implement VoiceOver accessibility support ✅ COMPLETED

## Priority: Medium

## Description
Ensure the app is fully accessible with VoiceOver for users with visual impairments.

## Accessibility Requirements

### Screen Readers
- **Welcome Screen**: 
  - Read greeting in both languages
  - Clear button labels
  - Navigation hints

### Game Cards
- **Face Down**: "Card face down, double tap to flip"
- **Face Up**: "[Animal] in Māori is [Te Reo name]"
- **Matched**: "[Animal] matched successfully"

### Game States
- Announce when two cards are flipped
- Announce match/no match results
- Announce game completion

### Implementation
```typescript
// Accessibility props
accessibilityLabel="Kurī - Dog"
accessibilityHint="Double tap to flip card"
accessibilityRole="button"
accessibilityState={{ selected: isFlipped }}
```

## Additional Considerations
- **High Contrast**: Support iOS high contrast mode
- **Font Scaling**: Support dynamic type sizes
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order
- **Announcements**: Use accessibility announcements
